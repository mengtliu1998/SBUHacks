# TapNGo

# Inspiration
As we age, we often feel that we are getting more and more forgetful. There are also cases where our loved ones suffer from a memory disorder. People often complain about forgetting their stuff (e.g. important documents, textbooks, umbrellas, keys, etc.) at home or suffers from being locked out of their homes. Therefore, we were inspired to create an GPS based app which alerts the user when they are about to leave their house to make sure that they have all their stuff.

# What it does
The app is GPS based and notifies the user when they walk out of the location that they set as their home. The app contains a modifiable list of items that the user or the user's family can set up beforehand to remind them of these items before they leave their home.

# How we built it
We built the mobile application using: Android Studio, Google APIs, Android Libraries, Open Source Permission Libraries, Weather API.

# Challenges we ran into
We faced challenges caused by network security while trying to access Weather APIs.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of our responsive UI, our beautiful icon, our intellectual app name, and our (pretty) accurate GPS.

# What we learned
We learned how to navigate through android mobile development using Android Studio and many different APIs and libraries. (And a lot of YouTube tutorials :D )

# What's next for TapNGo
Modifications: App support for weather tracking and notifications and will automatically add umbrella onto the list. Hopefully we can introduce additional functionalities so that our app becomes more versatile!

# Built Using:
-Android Studio
-Google's FusedLocationProviderClient API
-various Android libraries
-OpenWeather APi
